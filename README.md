A special flavor of Uniswap V2 meets EIP-4626 to form a yield optimized 
vault for Art Gobblers.

## Abstract

Art Gobblers is an experimental, decentralized, art factory using two new 
innovations, [GOO](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/09/goo) and 
[VRGDA](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda). Art Gobblers NFTs produce 
Goo according to this formula: $\sqrt{Goo * Mult}=Goo per day$

Goober allows a user to effectively pool their Goo and/or Gobblers with other 
users, such that they all receive more Goo emissions together than they would 
on their own.

The point of maximization for $\sqrt{x * y}$ happens to be at the point where 
$x=y$. However, due to market forces, that may not always be the point with 
the highest yield in outside terms. Thus, Goober optimizes $Î”k$ for $x+y$ 
using an $x*y=k$ constant function market maker, where $x=Goo$, $y=Mult$, 
and $k=Goo per day$, allowing market forces to maintain the optimal 
ratio of Goo/Gobblers in the pool.

Goober additionally uses this market to optimally mint new Gobblers to 
the pool using probabilistic pricing per gobbler multiplier compared to
the pool's internal pricing.
